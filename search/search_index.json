Latest stable version 1.16.3 / pre-release 17.x / changelog Rewrap The main Rewrap command is: Rewrap Comment / Text , by default bound to Alt+Q . With the cursor in a comment block, hit this to re-wrap the contents to the specified wrapping column . Features Re-wrap comment blocks in many languages, with per-language settings. Smart handling of contents, including Java-/JS-/XMLDoc tags and code examples. Can select lines to wrap or multiple comments/paragraphs at once (even the whole document). Also works with Markdown documents, LaTeX or any kind of plain text file. The contents of comments are usually parsed as markdown, so you can use lists, code samples (which are untouched) etc: See the docs site for more info. Selections If you select just a couple of lines, only those lines will be processed. In VS Code you can use multiple selections (alt+click) to select multiple comment blocks or line ranges. However you can safely select a large line range with multiple comments and code, and only the comments will be wrapped (the code is untouched). You can Ctrl+A, Alt+Q to re-wrap a whole document at once.

Settings can be made globally, or per language/file type group. Wrapping column The recommended way to set a wrapping column is to use a ruler (see below), which also gives a visual indication. If you don't want to do that, then you can use the \"Wrapping column\" setting. a value of 80 for example will wrap after 80 characters. Wrapping to rulers To enable wrapping to rulers, the \"Wrapping column\" setting must be left blank. Visual Studio doesn't come with a rulers feature, so this is done in combination with the Editor Guidelines extension. Once that extension is installed, you can right-click in the editor to add guidelines manually, or you can set them up in an .editorconfig file . If you have multiple rulers, you can choose which ruler to wrap to while editing . Wrap whole comments With \"Wrap whole comments\" set to true (default), Rewrap will wrap a whole comment block when a text cursor is inside it. But when set to false , Rewrap will only wrap that paragraph within the comment. \\ (Here the second paragraph is not wrapped) Note: This setting only affects empty selections. You can always manually select the lines to wrap. Double sentence spacing If enabled, whenever a paragraph is wrapped, for any lines that end in \".\", \"?\" or \"!\", two spaces will be added after that sentence when the paragraph is rewrapped. This is not enabled by default. ( details ) Per-language settings Per-language settings can be added by clicking on the \"Add...\" button at the end of the list. Choose the languages to add to the group, and set the options for the group as needed. If an option here is left blank the global setting will be used. Auto-wrap Auto-wrap is turned off by default. Turning it on is global: it affects all documents edited. In code files, only comments will be affected, so it's pretty safe to leave it on. On the Edit menu, under the Rewrap Lines command, is the Toggle Auto-Wrap item. The check-mark shows the status and a brief statusbar message is shown when turning on/off. You can add a keybinding for the Toggle Auto-Wrap command. Keybindings The Rewrap command is by default bound to Alt+Q . This can be changed if you wish by going to Tools > Options , then Environment > Keyboard . In this dialog pane search for the command Edit.RewrapLines and you can add a different shortcut.

This has a default of 80. Wrapping to rulers To enable wrapping to rulers, rewrap.wrappingColumn must not be set. If you have a ruler set up in VS Code, Rewrap will wrap to that ruler. If you have multiple rulers, you can choose which ruler to wrap to while editing. Just press Alt+Q multiple times to wrap to each ruler in turn. The ruler chosen is then remembered for that document for the rest of the session. It cycles through the rulers in the order in which they appear in settings; so if you have a most commonly used ruler, you probably want to put that first. Whole Comment \"rewrap.wholeComment\" : true ` When this is true , Rewrap will wrap a whole comment block when a text cursor is inside it. But when set to false , Rewrap will only wrap that paragraph within the comment. (Here the second paragraph is not wrapped) Note: This setting only affects empty selections.

Double Sentence Spacing \"rewrap.doubleSentenceSpacing\" : false If enabled, whenever a paragraph is wrapped, for any lines that end in \".\", \"?\" or \"!\", two spaces will be added after that sentence when the paragraph is rewrapped. This is not enabled by default. ( details ) Auto-wrap Auto-wrap works like the auto-fill mode in Emacs. When pressing <space> or <enter> after the cursor is past the wrapping column, that line is wrapped onto the next. Like in the Emacs function, auto-wrap does not attempt to re-flow the entire paragraph; it only adds a break in the current line. It's handy when typing new text, but won't automatically fix a paragraph after inserting/removing text. For this you can always do a standard alt+q after making edits. Enabling Auto-wrap is disabled by default, but can be enabled with the Rewrap > Auto Wrap: Enabled setting. This setting ( rewrap.autoWrap.enabled ) can also be set per language/document type . Even when enabled, it will only activate within comments in code files, not on code lines, so it's usually ok to leave it enabled. To temporarily enable or disable auto-wrap for the current document , you can use the Rewrap: Toggle Auto-Wrap command in the command palette. There's no default keybinding for the toggle command, but you can add one, eg shift+alt+q , by binding to the command ID rewrap.toggleAutoWrap in the Keyboard Shortcuts editor . Notification To help keep track of when auto-wrap is on or off, there is a small (optional, but on by default) icon/notification in the right of the statusbar, that shows the auto-wrap state for the current document. It has 4 states: (normal) on (enabled in settings) (hidden) off (disabled in settings) (orange) temporarily enabled (from toggle command) (gray) temporarily disabled (from toggle command) Hovering over this icon will give more information. If you don't like the icon, you can hide it , or change the Rewrap > AutoWrap: Notification setting to \"text\" . Then it will instead show a brief text message in the status bar for a few seconds whenever auto-wrap is toggled on or off. Language-specific settings See also the VS Code documentation . This example sets the wrapping at column 72 for Python, with doubleSentenceSpacing on, and the wrapping column at 90 for Javascript. { \"[python]\" : { \"editor.rulers\" : [ 72 , 79 ], \"rewrap.doubleSentenceSpacing\" : true }, \"[javascript]\" : { \"editor.rulers\" : [ 90 ] } } VS Code has a helper command for adding language sections to your settings file: press F1 and search for Preferences: Configure Language Specific Settings... .

They are all in markdown format. The examples also serve as tests. Test layout An example test -> An example \u00a6 \u00a6 test \u00a6 Each test, set into an indented code block, consists of 2 sections, or columns, with the input on the left and and the expected output after the -> marker. Wrapping column The wrapping column in each sample is represented by \u00a6 character. It's required to appear on at least one line in the input and output sections (though for asthetics should appear on all lines where it can). It's checked that all \u00a6 markers are at the same column. Selections Most samples are treated as if they're wholly selected, though where selections are explicitly needed, they're marked with \u00ab\u00bb characters, with \u00ab as the anchor point and \u00bb as the active point. These are removed from the input. Whitespace Tabs are represented by -\u2192 . Where explicitly needed, spaces are represented by a \u00b7 (U+00B7). All lines are assumed to have no trailing whitespace unless these characters are used. Settings Settings for a test are given in a blockquote, on one line, separated by commas and colons. They apply to all subsequent tests until a new settings block is given. Eg: language: javascript, tabSize: 2, doubleSentenceSpacing: true When absent, the default values are used: - tabSize: 4 - doubleSentenceSpacing: false - language: plaintext - wrapWholeComment: true - reformat: false A new settings block completely replaces the previous one; any absent values are reset back to defaults. Writing tests If writing tests in VS Code, the first thing that's highly recommended is the Overtype extension, which gives a toggle to type in overtype mode with the 'ins' key. This project folder also has extra guideline rulers at columns 38 & 46 in markdown files, as well as a couple of code snipets. Steps: Press ctrl+space and select the test snippet. This will insert lines of spaces and put the cursor at the correct starting position. Using overtype mode, add the input text. Use the cursor keys to move down a line rather than enter. Add \u00a6 characters on all lines to indicate the wrapping column (you can copy this char from another test or use the wm snippet). You can do this quicker by first using ctrl+alt+down to make an insertion point on each line. Select all the input as a block by using ctrl+alt+up/down to select vertically, and shift+left/right to select horizontally. Copy, press End to move the insertion points to the end of each line (should be on col 47, at the 2nd ruler) and paste. Adjust input & output text as needed. On one of the lines, add a -> marker (dash + greater than) at col 39 (the first ruler). This can be on any line but for asthetics should be on/near the middle line of the block Additional notes/tips Though not outright banned, tests with identical input and output are discouraged, since something not working at all will produce a false pass. In tests where a non-wrapping block is expected, try to include another block that should wrap (eg. normal paragraph text). Tests are easier to see (and edit) if input and output contain the same amount of lines. When adding wrapped sections, try to add lines that will be split and lines that will be joined, to keep the number of lines after wrapping (almost) the same. When running tests, examples can be singled-out by adding the tag <only> at the end of any of their lines.","title":"Specs"},{"location":"specs/#specs","text":"The files in these folders use examples to document Rewrap's capabilities and specify expected results.

When running tests, examples can be singled-out by adding the tag <only> at the end of any of their lines.","title":"Additional notes/tips"},{"location":"specs/content-types/batch-file/","text":"Batch/Cmd files language: \"batch file\" Comments lines start with REM (or @REM ).
