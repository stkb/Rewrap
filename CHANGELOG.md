## Unreleased

- Add ERB (HTML) `.html.erb` (#265).
- Add support for [Block
  Strings](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/327)
  in GraphQL files. (#261)
- Add XAML type (#263).


## 1.14.0

- Make `autoWrap.enabled` a per-language setting; auto-wrap toggle command a
  per-document override. (#149)
- Add Clojure, Common Lisp, Emacs Lisp, Scheme, and J (#246, #240)
- Fix per-language settings sometimes not applying.
- Declare as a UI extension so it doesn't have to be installed in the remote
  workspace (#231); fixes locally-installed language extensions not being found
  when used with remote workspaces (#201).
- Add PostgreSQL (.p(g)sql)
- Markdown: preserve line-breaks after `<br(/)>` (#223).


## 1.13.0

- Change to how the indent of comment content is handled. Now, instead of taking
  the indent of the first line and applying it to rest of the comment, the whole
  comment is taken as-is with all indents being relative to the least indented
  line (that has text). [This allows the first line of a comment to be an
  indented code
  block](https://github.com/stkb/Rewrap/issues/203#issuecomment-637767932),
  which previously wasn't possible.
- Fix issues that broke wrapping for extension-contributed languages in v1.12.0.
- Markdown: Fix preserving indents in blockquote (#204).
- Fix HTML not working in Visual Studio.


## 1.12.0

  support is not there yet) (#157, #203).

- .Net XML docs: Only preserve line breaks before/after certain "block"
  elements; wrap all other elements inline (#174).

## 1.4.0

Important: if you still use and prefer the old keybinding for Rewrap (`ctrl+k ctrl+w`), please add it to your settings manually. It will be removed in the next version.

Rewrap is now also available for Visual Studio!

The main change in this release is that all<sup>1</sup> comments now are parsed as Markdown (CommonMark spec), enabling wrapping of bulleted/numbered lists and all other Markdown features.<sup>2</sup>

Additionally, a new setting: `wholeCommment`, has been added to give more control over wrapping comments. See [here](https://github.com/stkb/Rewrap/wiki/Settings-VSCode#wrapping-whole-or-parts-of-comments).

Added languages:
- Elixir
- Dart

Other fixes and changes:
- Supports unicode (#38)
- In js/javadoc, inline tags (eg: `{@link}`) aren't broken up (#35)
- Support doc-comments in PHP (#34)

----

<sup>1</sup> Except for .Net xml-doc comments.

<sup>2</sup> (This introduces a small breaking change: where code samples (which aren't rewrapped) within a comment previously only required a 2-space indent, now they require 4 spaces, in line with the Markdown spec.)


## 1.3.0

Added a new command; "Rewrap Comment / Text at column..." (id: `rewrap.rewrapCommentAt`). This allows you to re-wrap something at a custom wrapping width (#27).


## 1.2.0

- Added support for the new [language-specific settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_9#_language-specific-settings). Now you can customize `editor.rulers` and Rewrap's settings per language. (#25)
- Improvements for LaTeX:
  - Most \commands starting a line will now denote a new paragraph (#24).
  - Indentation for subsequent lines in that paragraph will be cleaned up (#23).
  - Line breaks following a line-break command (eg \\\\, \newline) will be preserved.
- Added basic support for TOML files (#26).


## 1.1.0

- Wrapping now works with js and css sections embedded in an html document (#22).
- Very basic support for (La)TeX files added.


## 1.0.0

Bumping up to version 1.0.0 since it was about time.

Two new features; see the README for details.
- Added a feature from Vim `gq` and Emacs `fill-paragraph`: when lines ending in a period are wrapped, two spaces will be added after the period in the wrapped text. To turn this feature on, add `rewrap.doubleSentenceSpacing: true` to your settings.json. (#17)
- If you use rulers, Rewrap can now take the wrapping column from the first value in the `editor.rulers` setting. `rewrap.wrappingColumn` is then no longer needed. (#19)

Bug fixes:
- Cursor/selection position after wrapping has been fixed. Now the text cursor should always stay next to the same word it was at before wrapping, allowing you to keep typing from where you left off. (#18)


### 0.6.4

This doesn't affect comments, only other plain text within a file (eg. in YAML files).
Now blocks of plain text with differing indents are treated as separate paragraphs. Previously a blank line was needed to separate paragraphs.

Eg: this text was treated as one paragraph but now as two.
```
Some text
    Some more text
```

Also doesn't affect markdown files, or .txt files, which are currently treated the same as markdown.


### 0.6.3

- Added """-comments for Python (previously only supported ''') (#15)
- Added # markers for ini files (includes other types of config files, eg .gitconfig)
- Fixed an error caused by empty comments (#11, #14)

Upgraded to TypeScript 2.0; vscode v1.6+ is now required.


### 0.6.2

Fixed a bug where the last line of comment sections of some types of files wouldn't be included in the wrapping (#12).

Types affected: dockerfile, ini, makefile, perl, r, rust, shellscript, vb, yaml


### 0.6.1

No longer hard-wraps very long words, eg URLs (#10)


## 0.6.0

Changed the default keybinding to Alt+Q (#5)

- Old keybinding (Ctrl+K Ctrl+W) still works for those used to that one.
- For those with a custom binding set, nothing changes.

Added AutoHotKey (.ahk) file support

Bug fixes:
- Fixed wrapping on unsaved files (#8)
- Fixed alignment of end-comment marker (#9)


### 0.5.3

Fixed problems with extensionless filenames.


### 0.5.2

VSCode v1.1.0 broke Rewrap. This release fixes it.


### 0.5.1

Fixed a filename issue, causing the extension not to work on Mac & Linux.


## 0.5.0

This release adds a markdown feature to all document types: You can end a line with 2 spaces to force a mid-paragraph line break after it.

```js
// This line ends with 2 spaces˽˽
// Because I want this to be on a new line
```

Speaking of markdown, the main new feature for this release is full markdown support. You can safely ctrl+a and then wrap a whole document at once to reformat all paragraphs appropriately without messing anything up.

Lastly, the selection moving/expanding after wrapping has been fixed (#4)


### 0.4.2

- If file is an unknown type, still provide plain text wrapping.
- Adds some better paragraph detection for markdown.
  - Mid-pararaph line breaks (2 trailing spaces)
  - List items


## 0.4.0

Now wraps to the correct visual column when using tabbed indents. (#2)


## 0.3.0

Skipping a version number because this version adds two new features.

- Doc comments: you can now run the command on a whole doc comment and now worry about param tags, code examples etc getting messed up. Rewrap now preserves these.
- Plain text: If you select something other than a comment it will be re-wrapped as plain text instead. Useful for text, markdown or html files etc, but works on any type of file.


## 0.1.0

Add support for many more languages:

bat, groovy, less, objective-c, sass, shaderlab, swift, coffeescript,
dockerfile, makefile, perl, perl6, r, shellscript, yaml, fsharp, haskell,
elm, purescript, ini, jade, lua, perl6, php, powershell, python, rust, sql, vb


## 0.0.2

First release.
