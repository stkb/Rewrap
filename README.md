# Rewrap

**Latest version: 1.5.0 ([view changes](https://github.com/stkb/vscode-rewrap/releases))**
 
Reformats code comments and other text to a given line length. For VSCode and [**now also for Visual Studio**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stkb.Rewrap-18980).

![Example](https://github.com/stkb/Rewrap/wiki/images/example.png)

Similar to wrap/fill paragraph in Sublime (alt+q) Emacs (M-q) or Vim (gq); but more powerful.


## Features ##

* Re-wrap single & multiline comment blocks in many languages. Also configure settings per language.
* Smart handling of contents, including java/js/xmldoc tags and code examples.
* Can select multiple comments/paragraphs at once (even the whole document).
* Also works with Markdown documents, LaTeX or any kind of plain text file.


## Using ##

The main Rewrap command is: **Rewrap Comment / Text**, by default bound to ```Alt+Q```.

Put the text cursor inside a comment line, block or plain text paragraph and invoke the command to wrap to the preset column (default is 80). You can also select just a few lines, or multiple comments in one selection.

**See the [Features](https://github.com/stkb/Rewrap/wiki/Features) page for more examples on how to use.**

A second command, **Rewrap Comment / Text a column...** allows you do a wrap at a custom column. This has no default keybinding, but is available in the command pallete (F1).


## Configuring ##

See the [wiki](https://github.com/stkb/vscode-rewrap/wiki) for pages on configuring settings and keybindings.
