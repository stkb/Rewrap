## Plain text

Tabs in the indent are preserved.

As long as tab stops represent more that 1 space in the editor, a single tab
character will separate paragraphs by indent.

> language: "plaintext", tabWidth: 2

    -→a b c       ->      -→a b¦
    -→d  ¦                -→c d¦
    -→-→e f               -→-→e¦
         ¦                -→-→f¦

## Comments ##

> language: "c", tabWidth: 4

All tabs in the comment prefix are preserved.

    ---→//-→text text text       ->      ---→//-→text text
    ---→//-→text        ¦                ---→//-→text text


### Odd cases ###

It also works with a mix of tabs and spaces on one line

    ··-→·// text text text      ->      ··-→·// text text   ¦
                        ¦               ··-→·// text        ¦

Tabs in the comment content can make things tricky, and therefore all tabs
that appear after the column where text begins are converted to spaces when wrapping.

    ---→//·text text text      ->      ---→//·text text  ¦
    ---→//-→text      ¦                ---→//··text text ¦

### Markdown ###

Because tab characters in the middle of a line could produce weird results when
wrapping, all tabs are replaced with the correct number of spaces when wrapping.
This only happens on lines that are wrapped.
